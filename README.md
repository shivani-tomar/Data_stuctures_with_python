# Welcome to the Data_stuctures_with_python wiki!

"_**Data_structures_with_python**_" is a repository which consist of implementation of all the data structures using python language in as very _simple coding style using oops concepts_, _easy to understand_ and _easy to run_. You can easily manipulate data and run codes on your own data without any headache of internal working.



Following are the steps to run code on your own code: -

**Step - 1** :- First you need to install python on your desktop or laptop. Follow below steps to install python on your 
                local 
            if it is not installed otherwise you can skip this step and go ahead.

* Visit the link "[Python Installation](https://www.python.org/)"
* Go to the "_**Downloads**_" tab on the web page and install python according to your operating system 
              installed in your computer/laptop/desktop.

**Step - 2** : - Follow below steps to confirm python installation.

**For Windows** : - 
* Press "windows + r"
* Type "cmd" in the pop up and press "enter"
* A black terminal will open up. Type "python -v".
* If it is showing the version which you have installed the python is correctly installed in 
  your 
* Local otherwise there is problem while installation.Then try to uninstall it and install it 
  again.


**For Linux ** : -
* open terminal by clicking on the icon from the menu list on the left side.
* run command "python -v" and check for the correct installed python.

**Step - 3 ** :- Clone this repository or download it in the targeted folder in which you want to do it by git clone 
                command. Follow below commands:-

* Suppose there is a folder "alex" in which you want to clone the repository. 
* Go to the terminal and type "cd alex" and hit enter.
* To clone repository type "git clone https://github.com/shivani-tomar/Data_stuctures_with_python" and hit 
  enter. 

**Step - 4** : -  Now, go to the particular data_structure folder by using cd command and run main.py by using command 
                  
* "python main.py" and hit enter.
* The result will be shown on the output terminal and if you want to run code on your data the open main.py 
  using your favourite IDE or Editor like _**notepad , notepad++ , sublime , vscode , vim , tiny vim , pycharm**_               
  etc and edit the data which you want, then save file and run it.  
               



                                             # ALL THE BEST!!!!!!!
